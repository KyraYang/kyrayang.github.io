In this episode of The Nature of Things, Nuzuki tried to show us the vulnerable and remarkable of rabbits. In the first 15 minutes, he used rabbits in the city, its cousins, hares, and endangered cottontail to show the fragility of rabbits.

At the very beginning, there were several establish shot and Nuzuki's voice over. He told us the basic information about the rabbit and the relationship between the rabbit and us. Indeed they live so close to us in the city, but too common that we neglect them most of the time. With the scene of the rabbit in the city, the distance between us and the rabbit is closer, and we became interested in this mystery neighbor.

With an establish shot of desert, Nuzuki introduced us antelope jackrabbits. In a close-up, we can see the huge ears and big eyes of this hare, which gave an impression to us. At the same time, Nuzuki gave the statistic of the hare which were impressed even more.

Such a huge hare that it seemed to be safe from predators. However, that's not the truth. Through a shot/reverse shot between a hare and two Harris's hawks, Nuzuki showed us the vulnerable of the hare. No matter how hare ran or hid, it got caught at the end.

After the tragedy of the hare, the scene shifted to the New England cottontail, which is a rare rabbit who facing the loss of habitat. After watching the death of the jackrabbit, cottontail looked even more vulnerable. Fortunately, they have dedicate zoologists with them. With the voice of a zoologist, the scene showed us how the rabbits were saved.

However, the future of cottontails was still unknown, after leaving the zoo and back to the wild, they were all on their own again. They were not going to have delicate care anymore, and there were going to be predators, humans, diseases outside the zoo. To make the audience feel the uncertainty, a point of view of the cottontail during transportation was given. With the shacking of the cage, only can see the back door of the van, you just can't stop wondering where I was heading to.

The curiosity was formed, but with a long shot of a van on the road, this section was ended. Want to know the result? Wait for the next section. That's the trick that Nuzuki used to catch our hearts.
